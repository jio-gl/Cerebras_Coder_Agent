Create a web scraping utility that extracts product information from an e-commerce website. The utility should:

1. Use asyncio for concurrent requests
2. Implement proper rate limiting to avoid overloading the target server
3. Extract product names, prices, ratings, and image URLs
4. Save the data to both CSV and JSON formats
5. Include error handling for network issues and parsing failures
6. Implement a command-line interface with options for:
   - Setting the target URL
   - Controlling the crawl depth
   - Setting rate limits
   - Choosing output formats
7. Add comprehensive logging with different verbosity levels
8. Include proper documentation with usage examples
9. Write unit tests for the core functionality
10. Use type hints throughout the codebase
