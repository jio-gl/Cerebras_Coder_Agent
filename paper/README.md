This directory contains the LaTeX source files for the research paper describing the Cerebras-powered intelligent coding agent developed for the Cerebras Hackathon 2024.

## Paper Overview

**Title:** Cerebras-Powered Intelligent Coding Agent: A Self-Improving AI System for Automated Software Development

**Abstract:** We present a novel self-improving intelligent coding agent that leverages Cerebras' ultra-fast inference infrastructure and advanced large language models for automated software development. Our system introduces a formal framework for tool-based code manipulation, implements a mathematically grounded self-improvement algorithm, and achieves sub-second response times through optimized inference pipelines.
